THREEPIO
Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
THREEPIO
We're doomed!
THREEPIO
There'll be no escape for the Princess this time ... What's that?
THREEPIO
Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
THREEPIO
At last!  Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.
THREEPIO
What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel, smashed into who knows what!
THREEPIO
Wait a minute, where are you going?
STORMTROOPER
The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
VADER
Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans?
REBEL
We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
VADER
If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?
VADER
Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the passengers, I want them alive!
STORMTROOPER
There's one. Set for stun!
STORMTROOPER
She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
THREEPIO
Hey, you're not permitted in there.  It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.
THREEPIO
Don't you call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.
THREEPIO
Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there!
THREEPIO
I'm going to regret this.
OFFICER
There goes another one.
OFFICER
Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited.
THREEPIO
That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
THREEPIO
Are you sure this thing is safe?
LEIA
Darth Vader, Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
VADER
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
LEIA
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
VADER
You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor. Take her away!
OFFICER
Holding her is dangerous. Word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
VADER
I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only lead to find their secret base!
OFFICER
She'll die before she'll tell you anything.
VADER
Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
OFFICER
Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
VADER
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time.
THREEPIO
How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.
THREEPIO
I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen.
THREEPIO
What a desolate place this is.
THREEPIO
Where do you think you're going?
THREEPIO
Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier.
THREEPIO
What makes you think there are settlements over there?
THREEPIO
Don't get technical with me.
THREEPIO
What mission?  What are you talking about?
THREEPIO
I've just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
THREEPIO
And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.
THREEPIO
No more adventures. I'm not going that way.
THREEPIO
That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.
THREEPIO
Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved!
THREEPIO
Over here! Hey! Hey! Help! Please, help!
THREEPIO
Artoo? Artoo-Detoo! It is you! It is you!
STORMTROOPER
Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.
STORMTROOPER
Look, sir - droids.
THREEPIO
We've stopped! Wake up! Wake up!
THREEPIO
We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down?
THREEPIO
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end?
BERU
Luke? Luke!
BERU
Luke, tell your uncle if he gets a translator be sure it speaks Bocce.
LUKE
Doesn't look like we have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
OWEN
Yeah I'll take that red one. No, not that one.
OWEN
You, I suppose you're programmed for etiquette and protocol.
THREEPIO
Proticol? Why it's my primary function sir. I am well versed in all customs.
OWEN
I have no need for a protocol droid.
THREEPIO
Of course you haven't sir, not in an environment such as this. That is why I have been programmed...
OWEN
What I really need is a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
THREEPIO
Vaporators!  Sir, my first job was programming binary load lifters - very similar to your vaporators in most respects...
OWEN
Can you speak Bocce?
THREEPIO
Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me. I'm as fluent in...
OWEN
All right shut up - I'll take this one.
OWEN
Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want them cleaned up before dinner.
LUKE
But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!
OWEN
You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on, get to it!
LUKE
All right, come on. And the red one, come on.
LUKE
Well, come on, Red, let's go.
LUKE
Uncle Owen! This R2 unit has a bad motivator, look!
OWEN
Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
THREEPIO
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.
LUKE
Uncle Owen! What about that one?
OWEN
What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.
THREEPIO
I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes.
LUKE
Okay, let's go...
THREEPIO
Now, don't you forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
THREEPIO
Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
LUKE
It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!
THREEPIO
Is there anything I might do to help?
LUKE
Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
THREEPIO
I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
LUKE
Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
THREEPIO
I see, sir.
LUKE
Uh, you can call me Luke.
THREEPIO
I see, sir Luke.
LUKE
No, just Luke.
THREEPIO
And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
LUKE
Hello.
LUKE
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
THREEPIO
With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
LUKE
You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
THREEPIO
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
LUKE
Have you been in many battles?
THREEPIO
Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
LUKE
Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or a...
LEIA
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
LUKE
What's this?
THREEPIO
What is what?!?  He asked you a question, what is that?
LEIA
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
THREEPIO
Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.
LUKE
Who is she? She's beautiful.
THREEPIO
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
THREEPIO
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, I believe. Our captain was attached to...
LUKE
Is there any more to this recording?
THREEPIO
Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us into trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.
THREEPIO
He says that he is the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.
THREEPIO
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with all we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
LUKE
Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
THREEPIO
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
LUKE
Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit.
LUKE
I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.
THREEPIO
He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
LUKE
Hmm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off. Okay.
LUKE
There you go... Wait a minute - Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.
THREEPIO
'What message?' The one you've justbeen playing. The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
BERU
Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
LUKE
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
THREEPIO
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
LUKE
Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.
THREEPIO
Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
THREEPIO
No, I don't think he likes you at all.
THREEPIO
No, I don't like you either.
LUKE
You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
OWEN
What makes you think that?
LUKE
Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
LUKE
I thought he might have meant Old Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  I wonder if he's related to Ben.
OWEN
That wizards just a carzy old man. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory erased.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.
LUKE
But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
OWEN
He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.
LUKE
He knew my father?
OWEN
I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them up there on the south ridge working out those condensers.
LUKE
Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement, about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
OWEN
You mean the next semester before harvest?
LUKE
Sure, there're more than enough droids.
OWEN
Harvest is when I need you the most.  It's only one season more.  This year we'll make enough on the harvest that I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.
OWEN
You must understand I need you here, Luke.
LUKE
But it's a whole 'nother year.
OWEN
It's only one more season.
LUKE
Yeah, that's what you said when Biggs and Tank left.
BERU
Where are you going?
LUKE
It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to go finish cleaning those droids.
BERU
Owen, he can't stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.
OWEN
I'll make it up to him next year.  I promise.
BERU
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.
OWEN
That's what I'm afraid of.
LUKE
What are you doing hiding back there?
THREEPIO
It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
LUKE
Oh, no...
THREEPIO
That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. 
LUKE
How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!
THREEPIO
Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
LUKE
It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.
OWEN
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.
LUKE
All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it.
LUKE
You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
THREEPIO
Oh, he excels at that, sir.
OWEN
Luke?  Luke?  Luke?
OWEN
Have you seen Luke this morning?
BERU
He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.
OWEN
Did he take those two new droids with him?
BERU
I think so.
OWEN
Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired by midday or there'll be hell to pay.
LUKE
Look, there's a droid on the scanner, dead ahead! Might be our little R2 unit, hit the accelerator.
LUKE
Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
THREEPIO
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
LUKE
No it's alright, but I think we better go...What's wrong with him now?
THREEPIO
He says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
LUKE
Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's go have a look.  Come on.
LUKE
Well, there are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.
BEN
Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.
BEN
Oh don't worry, he'll be all right.
BEN
Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate to be all in one piece.
LUKE
Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you!
BEN
The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
LUKE
This little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master but I've never seen such devotion in a droid before.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?
BEN
Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I've not heard in a long time... a long time.
LUKE
I think my uncle knows him.  He said he was dead.
BEN
Oh, he's not dead, not yet.
LUKE
Oh you know him?
BEN
Well of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh before you were born.
LUKE
Well then the droid does belong to you.
BEN
Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting...
BEN
I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they'll soon be back and in greater numbers.
LUKE
... Threepio!
THREEPIO
Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...
LUKE
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
THREEPIO
I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
LUKE
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?
BEN
Quickly... they're on the move.
LUKE
No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
BEN
That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
LUKE
You fought in the Clone Wars?
BEN
Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
LUKE
I wish I'd known him.
BEN
He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...
BEN
I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. 
THREEPIO
Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
LUKE
Sure, go ahead.
LUKE
What is it?
BEN
Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
BEN
An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.
LUKE
How did my father die?
BEN
A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
LUKE
The Force?
BEN
Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.
BEN
Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, and where you come from.
LUKE
I saw part of the message...
BEN
I seem to have found it.
LEIA
General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
BEN
You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
LUKE
Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
BEN
I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
LUKE
I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.
BEN
That's your uncle talking.
LUKE
My uncle, how am I ever going to explain this?
BEN
Learn about the Force, Luke.
LUKE
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
BEN
You must do what you feel is right, of course.
OFFICER
Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.
OFFICER
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!
OFFICER
The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....
TARKIN
The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.  I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.  The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
OFFICER
That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
TARKIN
The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.
OFFICER
And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
VADER
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
OFFICER
Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!
VADER
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
OFFICER
Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden...
VADER
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
TARKIN
Enough of this!  Vader, release him!
VADER
As you wish.
TARKIN
This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
LUKE
It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
BEN
They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide their numbers.
LUKE
These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
BEN
And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
LUKE
Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
LUKE
If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!
BEN
Wait, Luke!  It's too dangerous.
LUKE
Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!
VADER
And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.
BEN
There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.  You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.
LUKE
I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
BEN
Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.
STORMTROOPER
How long have you had these droids?
LUKE
About three or four seasons.
BEN
They're for sale if you want them.
STORMTROOPER
Let me see your identification.
BEN
You don't need to see his identification.
STORMTROOPER
We don't need to see his identification.
BEN
These are not the droids you're looking for.
STORMTROOPER
These are not the droids we're looking for.
BEN
He can go about his business.
STORMTROOPER
You can go about your business.
BEN
Move along.
STORMTROOPER
Move along.  Move along.
THREEPIO
I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.
LUKE
Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.
BEN
The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.
LUKE
Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
BEN
Most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.
LUKE
I'm ready for anything.
THREEPIO
Come along, Artoo.
BARTENDER
We don't serve their kind here!
LUKE
What?
BARTENDER
Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.
LUKE
Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.
THREEPIO
I heartily agree with you sir.
BAR PATRON
He doesn't like you.
LUKE
I'm sorry.
BAR PATRON
I don't like you either. You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.
LUKE
I'll be careful.
BAR PATRON
You'll be dead.
BEN
This little one isn't worth the effort.  Now let me buy you something...
BARTENDER
No blasters!  No blaster!
BEN
This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
THREEPIO
I don't like the look of this.
HAN
Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
BEN
Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.
HAN
Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
BEN
Should I have?
HAN
It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
HAN
I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?
BEN
Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
HAN
What is it?  Some kinda local trouble?
BEN
Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
HAN
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand all in advance.
LUKE
Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!
HAN
But who's going to fly it, kid? You?
LUKE
You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...
BEN
We could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
HAN
Seventeen, huh?
HAN
Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.
BEN
Ninety-four.
HAN
Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
TROOPER
All right, we'll check it out.
HAN
Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.
BEN
You'll have to sell your speeder.
LUKE
That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.
GREEDO
Going somewhere, Solo?
HAN
Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
GREEDO
It's too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance.  Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  I'm lucky I found you first.
HAN
Yeah, but this time I got the money.
GREEDO
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
HAN
I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...
GREEDO
Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
HAN
Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?
GREEDO
You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.
HAN
Over my dead body.
GREEDO
That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
HAN
Yes, I'll bet you have.
HAN
Sorry about the mess.
VADER
Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
OFFICER
The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?
TARKIN
Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
VADER
What do you mean?
TARKIN
I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Alderaan.
OFFICER
With pleasure.
THREEPIO
Lock the door, Artoo.
STORMTROOPER
All right, check that side of the street.  It's locked, move on to the next door.
THREEPIO
I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.
THREEPIO
You watch your language!
LUKE
He says it's the best he can do.  Ever since the XP-38 came out, they just aren't in demand.
BEN
It'll be enough.
BEN
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
LUKE
What a piece of junk.
HAN
She'll make point five past light speed.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  Plus I've added some special modifications myself.
HAN
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll get aboard, we'll get out of here.
THREEPIO
Hello, sir.
STORMTROOPER
Which way?
STORMTROOPER
All right, men.  Load your weapons!
STORMTROOPER
Stop that ship! Blast 'em!
HAN
Chewie, get us out of here!
THREEPIO
Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
HAN
It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
HAN
Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
LUKE
Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.
HAN
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!
HAN
Here's where the fun begins!
BEN
How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
HAN
It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
LUKE
Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...
HAN
Traveling through hyperspace aint't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
LUKE
What's that flashing?
HAN
We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.
OFFICER
We've entered the Alderaan system.
LEIA
Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
TARKIN
Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
LEIA
I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
TARKIN
Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
LEIA
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
TARKIN
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.
LEIA
No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons...
TARKIN
You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!
TARKIN
I grow tired of asking this, so it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?
LEIA
Dantooine, They're on Dantooine
TARKIN
There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.
LEIA
What?
TARKIN
You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. 
LEIA
No!
OFFICER
Commence primary ignition.
LUKE
Are you all right?  What's wrong?
BEN
I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.
BEN
You'd better get on with your exercises.
HAN
Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.
HAN
Don't everyone thank me at once.
HAN
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
THREEPIO
Now be careful, Artoo.
THREEPIO
He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.
HAN
Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
THREEPIO
But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
HAN
That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.
THREEPIO
I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.
BEN
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
LUKE
You mean it controls your actions?
BEN
Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
HAN
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
LUKE
You don't believe in the Force, do you?
HAN
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
HAN
It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
BEN
I suggest you try it again, Luke.
BEN
This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
LUKE
With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?
BEN
Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.
BEN
Stretch out with your feelings.
BEN
You see, you can do it.
HAN
I call it luck. 
BEN
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
HAN
Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else.
HAN
Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
LUKE
You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.
BEN
That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.
TARKIN
Yes?
OFFICER
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
TARKIN
She lied!  She lied to us!
VADER
I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
TARKIN
Terminate her... immediately!
HAN
Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.
HAN
What the... we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts.
LUKE
What's going on?
HAN
Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
LUKE
What do you mean?  Where is it?
HAN
Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.
LUKE
What?  How?
BEN
Destroyed... by the Empire!
HAN
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
HAN
There's another ship coming in.
LUKE
Maybe they know what happened.
BEN
It's an Imperial fighter.
LUKE
It followed us!
BEN
No.  It's a short range fighter.
HAN
There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?
LUKE
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
HAN
Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.
BEN
You might as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.
HAN
Not for long...
BEN
A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
LUKE
Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...
HAN
Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.
LUKE
Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.
HAN
I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
BEN
That's no moon...  It's a space station.
HAN
It's too big to be a space station.
LUKE
I have a very bad feeling about this.
BEN
Turn the ship around!
HAN
Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
LUKE
Why are we still moving towards it?
HAN
We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!
LUKE
There's gotta be something you can do!
HAN
There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!
BEN
You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.
TARKIN
Yes?
OFFICER
We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
VADER
They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.
OFFICER
There's no one on board, sir.  According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.  It must be a decoy, sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
VADER
Did you find any droids?
OFFICER
No, sir.  If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
VADER
Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.
OFFICER
Yes, sir.
VADER
I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...
OFFICER
Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.  I want every part of this ship checked!
STORMTROOPER
There's no one here.
LUKE
Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
HAN
I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
BEN
Leave that to me!
HAN
Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
BEN
Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
STORMTROOPER
The ship's all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.  All right, let's go.
HAN
Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?
OFFICER
TK-four-one-two.  Why aren't you at your post?  TK-four-one-two, do you copy? 
OFFICER
Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.
LUKE
You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
HAN
Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
THREEPIO
We found the computer outlet, sir.
BEN
Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
THREEPIO
He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
THREEPIO
The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
BEN
I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.
HAN
Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
LUKE
I want to go with you.
BEN
Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids. They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you, always.
HAN
Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil?
LUKE
Ben is a great man.
HAN
Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
LUKE
I didn't hear you give any ideas...
HAN
Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...
LUKE
Who do you think... What is it?
THREEPIO
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says "I found her," and keeps repeating, "She's here."
LUKE
Well, who... who has he found?
THREEPIO
Princess Leia.
LUKE
The princess?  She's here?
HAN
Princess?
LUKE
Where... where is she?
HAN
Princess?  What's going on?
THREEPIO
Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
LUKE
Oh, no...  We've got to do something.
HAN
What are you talking about?
LUKE
The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.
HAN
Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.
LUKE
But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
HAN
I'm not going anywhere.
LUKE
But they're going to execute her.  Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay. 
HAN
Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
LUKE
But they're going to kill her!
HAN
Better her than me...
LUKE
She's rich.
HAN
Rich?
LUKE
Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
HAN
What?
LUKE
Well more wealth that you can imagine.
HAN
I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
LUKE
You'll get it!
HAN
I better!
LUKE
You will!
HAN
All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this! What's your plan?
LUKE
Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?
LUKE
Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you.
LUKE
Okay.  Han, you put these on.
HAN
Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.
THREEPIO
Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
LUKE
Lock the doors.
HAN
And hope they don't have blasters.
THREEPIO
That isn't very reassuring.
LUKE
I can't see a thing in this helmet.
HAN
This is not going to work.
LUKE
Why didn't you say so before?
HAN
I did say so before!
OFFICER
Where are you taking this... thing?
LUKE
Prisoner transfer from cellblock one-one-three-eight.
OFFICER
I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.
HAN
Look out!  He's loose!
HAN
We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.  Here it is... twenty-one-eighty-seven.  You go and get her.  I'll hold them here.
HAN
Everything is under control.  Situation normal.
OFFICER
What happened?
HAN
Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?
OFFICER
We're sending a squad up.
HAN
Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here, uh, now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous.
OFFICER
Who is this?  What's your operating number?
HAN
Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!
LEIA
Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
LUKE
What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you. 
LEIA
You're who?
LUKE
I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
LEIA
Ben Kenobi?  Where is he?
LUKE
Come on!
VADER
He is here...
TARKIN
Obi-Wan Kenobi?  What makes you think so?
VADER
A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
TARKIN
Surely he must be dead by now.
VADER
Don't underestimate the Force.
TARKIN
The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
TARKIN
Yes?
OFFICER
We have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three.
TARKIN
The princess?  Put all sections on alert!
VADER
Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.
TARKIN
If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
VADER
Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.
HAN
Chewie? Get behind me!  Get behind me!
HAN
Can't get out that way.
LEIA
Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
HAN
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
LUKE
See-Threepio?  See-Threepio!
THREEPIO
Yes sir?
LUKE
We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that?  I didn't copy!
THREEPIO
I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.  The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.
STORMTROOPER
Open up in there!
THREEPIO
Oh, no!
LUKE
There isn't any other way out.
HAN
I can't hold them off forever!  Now what?
LEIA
This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
HAN
He is the brains, sweetheart.
LUKE
Well, I didn't...
HAN
What the hell are you doing?
LEIA
Somebody has to save our skins.  Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
HAN
Get in there you big furry oaf!  I don't care what you smell!  Get in there and don't worry about it.
HAN
Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!
HAN
Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...
LUKE
No!  wait!
LUKE
Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!
LEIA
Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.
HAN
Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
LEIA
It could be worse...
HAN
It's worse.
LUKE
There's something alive in here!
HAN
That's your imagination.
LUKE
Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?
HAN
What?
HAN
Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
LEIA
Luke!
LEIA
Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
LUKE
Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.
HAN
Where?
LUKE
Anywhere!  Oh!!
HAN
Luke!  Luke!
LEIA
Grab him! What happened?
LUKE
I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
HAN
I've got a very bad feeling about this.
LUKE
The walls are moving!
LEIA
Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.
LUKE
Wait a minute!
LUKE
Threepio?  Come in Threepio!  Threepio!  Where could he be?
STORMTROOPER
Take over!
THREEPIO
They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them.
STORMTROOPER
Follow me!  You stand guard.
THREEPIO
Come on!
THREEPIO
All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.  If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
TROOPER
All right.
LUKE
Threepio?  Come in, Threepio! Threepio!
HAN
Get to the top!
LEIA
I can't! 
LUKE
Where could he be?  Threepio!  Threepio, will you come in?
THREEPIO
They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured. Hurry!
HAN
One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it!
LEIA
I'm trying!
THREEPIO
Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be?
THREEPIO
Use the comlink?  Oh, my!  I forgot, I forgot!
THREEPIO
Are you there, sir?
LUKE
Threepio?
THREEPIO
We've had some problems...
LUKE
Will you shut up and listen to me! Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you?  Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
THREEPIO
No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!
THREEPIO
Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!
LUKE
Threepio, we're all right! We're all right.  You did great.
LUKE
Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? Three-two-six-three-eight-two-seven.
HAN
If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.
LUKE
Well, let's get moving!
HAN
Where are you going?
LEIA
No, wait.  They'll hear!
HAN
Come here, you big coward! Chewie! Come here!
LEIA
Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?
HAN
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I take orders from one person!  Me!
LEIA
It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
HAN
No reward is worth this.
STORMTROOPER
Do you know what's going on?
STORMTROOPER
Maybe it's another drill.
STORMTROOPER
What was that?
STORMTROOPER
Oh, it's nothing.  Don't worry about it.
HAN
There she is.
LUKE
See-Threepio, do you copy?
THREEPIO
For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
LUKE
We're right above you.  Stand by.
LEIA
You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.
HAN
Nice!  Come on!
STORMTROOPER
It's them!  Blast them!
HAN
Get back to the ship!
LUKE
Where are you going?  Come back!
LEIA
He certainly has courage.
LUKE
What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?  Come on!
LUKE
I think we took a wrong turn.
LEIA
There's no lock!
LUKE
That oughta hold it for a while.
LEIA
Quick, we've got to get across.  Find the control that extends the bridge.
LUKE
Oh, I think I just blasted it.
LEIA
They're coming through!
LUKE
Here, hold this.
LEIA
Here they come!
LEIA
For luck!
THREEPIO
Where could they be?
STORMTROOPER
Close the blast doors!
STORMTROOPER
Open the blast doors!  Open the blast doors!
VADER
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.  We meet again, at last.  
VADER
The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.
BEN
Only a master of evil, Darth.
VADER
Your powers are weak, old man.
BEN
You can't win, Darth.  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
HAN
Didn't we just leave this party?
HAN
What kept you?
LEIA
We ran into some old friends.
LUKE
Is the ship all right?
HAN
Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
LUKE
Look!
THREEPIO
Come on, Artoo, we're going!
HAN
Now's our chance!  Go!
LUKE
No!
HAN
Come on!
LEIA
Come on!  Luke, its too late!
HAN
Blast the door!  Kid!
BEN
Run, Luke!  Run!
HAN
I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!
HAN
We're coming up on the sentry ships.  Hold 'em off!  Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!
LUKE
I can't believe he's gone.
LEIA
There wasn't anything you could have done.
HAN
Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!
HAN
You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!
LEIA
Here they come!
LUKE
They're coming in too fast!
LEIA
We've lost lateral controls.
HAN
Don't worry, she'll hold together.
HAN
You hear me, baby?  Hold together!
LUKE
Got him!  I got him!
HAN
Great kid!  Don't get cocky.
LEIA
There are still two more of them out there!
LUKE
That's it!  We did it!
LEIA
We did it!
THREEPIO
Help!  I think I'm melting! This is all your fault.
TARKIN
Are they away?
VADER
They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
TARKIN
You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work.
HAN
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
LEIA
That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
HAN
Easy... you call that easy?
LEIA
Their tracking us!
HAN
Not this ship, sister.
LEIA
At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
HAN
What's so important?  What's he carrying?
LEIA
The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!
HAN
It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!
LEIA
You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!
LEIA
Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
LUKE
I care!
LUKE
So... what do you think of her, Han?
HAN
I'm trying not to, kid.
LUKE
Good...
HAN
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
LUKE
No!
REBEL
You're safe!  When we heard about Alderaan, we had feared the worst.
LEIA
We don't have time for our sorrows, commander. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.
TARKIN
Yes?
OFFICER
We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.
REBEL
The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
PILOT
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
REBEL
Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
REBEL
The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
REBEL
Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
PILOT
That's impossible, even for a computer.
LUKE
It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.
REBEL
Man your ships!  And may the Force be with you!
OFFICER
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.
VADER
This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
REBEL
All flight troops, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations.
LUKE
So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
HAN
That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.
LUKE
Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  You're turning your back on them.
HAN
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.
HAN
Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!
HAN
What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.
LEIA
What's wrong?
LUKE
Oh, it's Han.  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. 
LEIA
He's got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.
LUKE
I wish Ben were here.
BIGGS
Hey Luke!  I don't believe it!  How are ya?
LUKE
I'll be right up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell you.
PILOT
Skywalker, are you sure you can handle this ship
BIGGS
Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
PILOT
You'll do all right.
LUKE
Thank you, sir.  I'll try.
BIGGS
I've gotta get aboard.  We'll hear all your stories when we getback.  All right?
LUKE
Alright. Hey, Biggs. I told you I'd make it someday.
BIGGS
It'll be like old times Luke. They'll never stop us.
REBEL
This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?
LUKE
Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo?
THREEPIO
Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back.
THREEPIO
You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?

LUKE

PILOT
Luke, pull up! Are you all right?
LUKE
I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.
OFFICER
We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!
VADER
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.  Get the crews to their fighters.
PILOT
Watch yourself!  There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.
LUKE
I'm on it.
PILOT
I'm going in. Cover me Porkins.
PILOT
I'm right with you Red Three

I've got a problem here.
PILOT
Eject!
PILOT

No, I'm all right...
OFFICER
The rebel base will be in firing range in seven minutes.
BEN
Luke, trust your feelings.
REBEL
Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals.  Enemy fighters coming your way.
LUKE
My scope's negative.  I don't see anything.
PILOT
Keep up your visual scanning. Here they come!
PILOT
Watch it, you've got one on your tail!
PILOT
I'm Hit!
LIKE
You've picked one up. Watch it!
PILOT
I can't see it!
PILOT

LUKE
I'll be right there.
VADER
Several fighters have broken off from the main group.  Come with me!
PILOT
Fall in. Fall in!
PILOT
Watch your back Luke. Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in!
LUKE
I'm hit, but not bad. Artoo, see what you can do with it.  Hang on back there.
PILOT
Red Six can you see Red Five?
PILOT
There's a heavy fire zone... Red Five, where are you?
LUKE
I can't shake him!
PILOT
I'm on him, Luke! Hold on!
PILOT
Blast it!  Biggs where are you?
LUKE
Thanks, Wedge.
PILOT
Good shooting, Wedge!
PILOT
Red Leader This is Gold Leader.  We're starting out attack run.

VADER

PILOT
The exhaust post is marked and locked in!
PILOT
Switch all power to front deflection screens. Switch all power to front deflection screens.
PILOT
How many guns do you think, Gold Five?
PILOT
I'd say about twenty guns.  Some on the surface, some on the towers.
REBEL
Death Star will be in range in five minutes. 
PILOT
Switch to targeting computer.
PILOT
Computer's locked.  Getting a signal.
PILOT
The guns... they've stopped!
PILOT
Stabilize your rear deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.
PILOT
They've coming in!  Three marks at two ten.
VADER
I'll take them myself!  Cover me!
PILOT
It's no good, I can't maneuver!
PILOT
Stay on target.
PILOT
We're too close.
PILOT
Stay on target!
PILOT
Loosen up!
PILOT
Gold Five to Red Leader, Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.
PILOT
I copy, Gold Five.
PILOT
They came from behind...
OFFICER
We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.  Should I have your ship standing by?
TARKIN
Evacuate?  In out moment of triumph?  I think you overestimate their chances!
OFFICER
Rebel base, three minutes and closing.
PILOT
Red Group, this is Red Leader. Rendezvous at mark six point one.
PILOT
This is Red Two.  Flying towards you.
PILOT
Red Three, standing by.
REBEL

PILOT
Copy, Base One.  Luke, take Red Two and Three.  Hold up here and wait for my signal... to start your run.
PILOT
This is it!
PILOT
We should be able to see it by now.
PILOT
Keep your eyes open for those fighters!
PILOT
There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are?
LUKE
No sign of any... wait! Coming in point three five.
PILOT
I see them.

PILOT
Almost there!
PILOT
I can't hold them!
PILOT
It's away!
PILOT
It's a hit!
PILOT
Negative. Negative!  It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface.
LUKE
Red Leader, we're right above you.  Turn to point oh-five; we'll cover for you.
PILOT
Stay there I just lost my starboard engine. Get set up for your attack run.
OFFICER
Rebel base, one minute and closing.
LUKE
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.  We're going in.  We're going in full throttle, that ought to keep those fighters off our back.
PILOT
Right with you, boss.
PILOT
Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time?
LUKE
It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.
PILOT
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
PILOT
My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port!  Are you sure the computer can hit it?
LUKE
Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!
PILOT
What about that tower?
LUKE
You worry about those fighters!  I'll worry about the tower!
LUKE
Artoo... that, that stabilizer's broken loose again!  See if you can't lock it down!
PILOT
Fights! Coming in point-three!
PILOT
I'm hit!  I can't stay with you.

Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there!
PILOT
Sorry!
VADER

Great shot, kid.  That was one in a million.
BEN
Remember, the Force will be with you... always.
LUKE
I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!
HAN
Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
LEIA
Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
LUKE
Oh, no!
THREEPIO
Oh, my!  Artoo!  Can you hear me?  Say something! You can repair him, can't you?
REBEL
We'll get to work on him right away.
THREEPIO
You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
LUKE
He'll be all right.
